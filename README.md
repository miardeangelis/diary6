In 1889, she left school to join her step-aunts Mary Emily Miller and Grace Miller in Paris. She came back to the United States in 1892 but returned to Europe the following year. She married Oscar Oeser, a German army officer, on October 1, 1895 and lived in Germany for the next thirty years. Their marriage began to deteriorate during World War I. They divorced in 1921.
